# Belly-Button-Biodiversity-Dashboard

## Overview of the Project:
Many bacterial species are not well-studied and many more remain unknown to science.  In this project, we're teaming with a meatless food products producer to help identify bacterial species that have an ability to synthesize proteins that have a taste and texture similar to beef.  Our hypothesis is that bacteria found on the human body may yield some strong candidates in this quest.   For our dataset, we've enlisted volunteers to swab their bellybuttons multiple times per week and share the samples for culturing and analysis.   In the dashboard presented in this project you can see severa visualizations of variety and number of bacteria that were taken from multiple samples of the belly buttons of our group of volunteers.
